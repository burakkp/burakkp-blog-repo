I studied computer science at vocational high school and the University of Ondokuz Mayis. After education, I worked in various areas as a system administrator, analyst, and test developer. I am specialized in developing Front-End Technologies.

I have worked for Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Eczacibasi, Nuhr B.V., and Corendon. My roles in projects included migration processes, application design/development, and bug fixes.

I started Capgemini on the 1st of November 2020.

Currently I am working at Rabobank as a Full Stack Developer
